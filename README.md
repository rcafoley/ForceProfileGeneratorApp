# ForceProfileGeneratorApp
This application generates force-time profiles for use in neuromuscular fatigue modeling. It allows researchers and clinicians to:- Create complex force profiles with multiple subtask types - Visualize force patterns over time - Combine multiple profiles for complex work simulations - Export data for further analysis
